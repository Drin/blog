# Declarative Bioinformatics (2019-08-05) (Work in Progress)

This post will attempt to describe and explore a "declarative programming interface" for
bioinformatics. The specific purpose of this declarative interface is to determine the
necessary subset of relational algebra, relational calculus, or other language that a
storage system would need to provide to support various bioinformatics use cases. I will
start with gene expression and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) use cases, but I will
explore how this interface generalizes to other bioinformatics use cases.

Bioinformatics is a broad field that tries to understand molecular and cellular biology
through the analysis of biological data. Taking a top-down approach to determining a declarative
programming interface, I start with some key biological entities and concepts that exist in
gene expression analysis and single cell RNA sequencing.

### List of Biological Entities and Concepts (Work in Progress)
Molecular and cellular biology terminology:

* subpopulation
* biological processes
* gene expression
* gene:
    * comes from RNA
    * a gene corresponds to a particular genomic region that codes for a protein
    * isoforms based on alternate splicing
* marker gene
* orthologous genes
* gene set - ...
* peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
* protein:
    * unit of work in biological mechanisms
    * participates in various pathways
* pathway:
    * lineage of protein activity preceding a particular biological mechanism

Sequencing terminology:

* sequencing run
* sequencing library
* sequencing read paired-end
* primer
* barcoded, full-length cDNA
* signal-to-noise ratio of scRNA-Seq:
    * signal - optical data from the reaction of interest 
    * noise  - obfuscation of signal from:
        * accumulated or lingering reagents
        * ...

Analysis terminology:

* enrichment analysis-based approach
* cellular state - a representation of cell life-cycle and function based on protein activity
* batch effect   - ...
* drop-out event - ...
* pipeline
* assay
* high-throughput assay
* transcript-level data
* within-tissue and cross-tissue

Ontology terminology:

* GO-BP
