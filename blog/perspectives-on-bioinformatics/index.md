# Perspectives on Bioinformatics

This blog series/section will aim to describe and detail bioinformatics from a computer science perspective and map the layers of
abstraction in bioinformatics to the layers of abstraction in computer science.

# Goals

The posts here will focus on the following goals:

1. Provide an understanding of bioinformatics for my research group
2. Explicitly describe the layers of abstraction in bioinformatics to make possible
   a feasible mapping to appropriate optimization tools available in database and
   storage systems research.
