# LDFI For Life
This is a blog series or section that will focus on the generalization (or extension)
of lineage driven fault-injection (LDFI) to bioinformatics and genomic sciences. I think
that there are some very interesting ideas here, that Peter has also had the thought of
(as seen on [his twitter][tweet-ldfi-for-life]) with the inspiration of
[Asha Karim][tweeter-asha].
