During 1-1 meeting today, the idea of LDFI 4 life was discussed a bit more in the context of potential
upcoming projects. In order to articulate the idea fairly well, the conversation went a little something
like this.

## high level ideas
* the "LDFI approach" is composed of roughly 3 components, each of which should have some mapping to the
  domain to be studied:
  
    * observability/tracing - on some level this could be using fluorescence to track where a protein may
      be present/visible, or it could be measuring expression in certain cells, or it could be quantity
      of cell-free molecules, or it could even be results of a simulation
      
    * fault-injection or what to perturb in order to get a different result - this could be a suggestion
      to knockout a different gene, this could be to make some modification of a protein or gene, or this
      could be a different string representation to use for dna, or different transcript to use, all in
      order to prevent a signal from one subsystem/pathway to another (where proteins are cellular
      signals).
    
    * replaying?

* there are multiple "loops" in biological science:
   
    * wetlab/experimental - scientists conduct experiments to study things such as gene knockouts, then
      based on results they alter the type of experiment they are interested in, or what they are testing
      in the experiment. For genomic experiments, this may be to research new protocols, or to find what
      differentiates response between multiple patients
      
    * bioinformatics/genomics - once an experiment is done, and the data is assembled or propagated up
      to higher level analysis, higher dimensional analysis or comparison to other experiments in a more
      computational matter is done, and then the experiment is altered in similar ways as mentioned above
      
    * there are many other loops, each dealing with different levels of abstraction or different levels
      of analysis in which some information is available which is not available at the abstraction above
      or below.
      
    * in each "loop," the LDFI approach can make different choices as to what interesting experiments
      can or should be done

* Lineage driven fault-injection was used to make testing of systems more efficient by avoiding faults
  that were known to be problematic and by avoiding faults that the system was known to tolerate.
