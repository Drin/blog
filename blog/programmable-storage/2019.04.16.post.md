# Programmable Access Libraries for Bioinformatics (Work in Progress)

We are interested in attempting to improve performance of data access for life science use cases,
specifically [the Human Cell Atlas (HCA)][hca].

## Ideas and Tasks
* collaborative filtering between OSDs given:
    * an ontology (for knowing the collaborative hierarchy)
    * partial aggregates (sort a sub-region then coordinate along intervals)
    * incremental computation
    * view maintenance
