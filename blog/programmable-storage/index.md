# Programmable Storage
This is a blog related to programmable storage systems research. This blog section will
also include specific details related to our research interest in storage access libraries
such as NetCDF, ROOT, and HDF5.

My focus will be more on HDF5, and so this blog section will be mostly relevant to HDF5,
although there are certainly going to be a lot of high-level abstractions and insights
that will be mentioned, as making progress only with HDF5 is not much of a PhD level
contribution (I don't think).
