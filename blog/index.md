# Research Blog
I am a 1st year PhD student in computer science, and I am interested in keeping my writings in an
accessible, "blog-able" format, and this is my first attempt at that!

#### Note
This is a repository for blog-like posts in markdown, in the style of [Frank McSherry's
Blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog).

I attempted to keep this README updated, but that lasted a very very short while. What I have
decided could be nice, is to link to various indexes for subdirectories, which will serve as a
hierarchical blog index. By doing it this way, I can also try out maintaining this blog in [mdbook
format](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/) as well.

This README may not always be kept up to date, but I'll do my best :)

## Course-related content
Here I have laid out the reading schedule for my CMPS 290S class and I will add
my reading responses as I do them.

I have also added a schedule at the top for my presentations, which will
include links to my presentation slides.

### Reading reviews by date
To make it easy to manage all content in a single location, I would like to keep reading reviews
organized in a single location named and organized by date. Since they will be located in a single
directory, I link it here, where the below section will continue to grow while I'm in grad school
(and potentially "forever"!).

### Reading reviews by course
For my own convenience, I am maintaining sections for each course where I can keep track of a
schedule of the readings for the quarter. I will try to maintain links to papers, and even links to
materials I prepare for any presentations I give.
