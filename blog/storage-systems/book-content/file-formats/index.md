# File Formats

Inspired by the [Albis][paper-albis] paper, one of the things my research group is interested in is
how file formats are an old standard that may hinder progress to future storage architectures.
Generally, file formats represent storage format and data layout (though, with some delay involved
in defragging, etc. the data).

Part of what we would like to do is find some way to bring insights found in Albis together with
the general ideas found in the [Boxwood][paper-boxwood] paper.
