# Overview
This blog series will explore the use of solver-aided languages in domain specific
contexts. Some domains that I am specifically interested in are:

* storage systems
* bioinformatics

[paper-swizzle-           inventor]: 
* distributed systems

While the field of solver-https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~emina/doc/swizzle.asplos19.pdfaided languages has been introduced to me via [Lindsey Kuper][blog-lkuper]
at UC Santa Cruz, some of these ideas are motivated by questions I commonly ask myself: "what if we
applied this idea to this topic?" or "what if we combine these ideas which seem related?"

# Thoughts and To-do
Until I fill this series out more, I want to keep a running tally of ideas:

* The application of solvers to help determine where to store data (and maybe which format)
    * This idea led me to swizzles and [Emina Torlak's work on swizzles][]
