# Envoyage Status 2019-04-10

Minimal status with the start of the quarter and having taken a very satisfying spring break.

### Soft Milestones
Over the next 3 weeks we'll try to hit a few milestones. Since we're all still new
to various technologies we aren't sure what parts we may be over or under allocating.

1. By Monday (04/15), we plan to have had some time to look over the example istio application
   and other possible existing distributed applications and decide what other features we
   want to work towards for the base application.
   
2. By the following Monday (04/22), we hope to have a good understanding of how to specify
   fault-injection and relevant controls to Istio, as well as a high-level understanding of
   how it imposes fault-injection and tracing on envoy proxies. This has been initially explored
   by Michelle and Kris already.
   
3. By Monday (05/06), we would like to:

   1. Have the base application functional with 3 key use cases implemented (use cases of the
      application that provide interesting enough features and complexity for fault-injection
      to be used).
      
   2. Have infrastructure (Istio vs. Envoy) decided on, comfortable with deploying, breaking,
      and triaging the system (when we inject a fault does everything look correct), and have
      necessary understanding of Istio/Envoy to begin trying to accommodate RLFI.
