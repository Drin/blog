# Programmable Access Libraries
This is a blog related to programmable storage systems research. Specifically, we are
interested in research relating to storage access libraries such as NetCDF, ROOT, and
HDF5.

My focus will be more on HDF5, and so this blog section will be mostly relevant to HDF5,
although there are certainly going to be a lot of high-level abstractions and insights
that will be mentioned, as making progress only with HDF5 is not much of a PhD level
contribution (I don't think).
