# CMPS 278 Paper Evaluation: Speedy Transactions in Multicore In-Memory Databases

## Review
1. This paper improves on previous approaches by minimizing overhead and improving locality of transaction metadata and data records, so that any given transaction can complete very quickly. Additionally, when a transaction commits, data records modified by the transaction are all associated with the same transaction ID (TID) and transaction metadata (TID word) in a way that provides better guarantees about serializability violations between transactions.

2. I wonder if the speedups achieved by the approach in this paper is due to the average case of transactions not updating many data records. If a transaction does update many records, I assume that the overhead of determining the maximum TID for data records modified by the transaction can create a lot of conflicts with other very fast transactions working on the same records. Also, due to the proposed motivation and localization of transaction ID assignment and how that improves transaction management, I wonder if this approach is also highly compatible with a data management system that would like to leverage GPUs.
