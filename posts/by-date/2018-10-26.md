# CMPS 290S Reading Response: Cloud Types for Eventual Consistency

## Summary
This paper proposes an approach for handling data consistency for applications that synchronize data types to cloud storage. The authors specifically mention mobile applications since network partitions can happen frequently on mobile devices. The paper details a proposed data model that ensures eventual consistency for an application without the developer explicitly following, or thinking about, the consistency protocol. The data model, which uses *cloud types*, is something that can be layered onto many different programming languages. To ensure that eventual consistency is not violated, the proposed solution is to use revision consistency, which has some similarities with how consistency is maintained by software version control systems.
