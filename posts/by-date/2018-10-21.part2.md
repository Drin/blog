# Paper Review: MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters

## Review
1. MapReduce was a new model for distributed parallel computing over large datasets. Inspired by *map* and *reduce* functions in functional languages, the idea was that many computations could be expressed in two phases: map and reduce. These phases could then be distributed in an automated, highly performant manner. This approach relies on good approaches for automatically partitioning input data, and also treating input data and intermediate data as key value pairs, where the reduce step typically returns 0 or 1 outputs.
