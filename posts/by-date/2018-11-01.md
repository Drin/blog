# Paper Review: The MemSQL Query Optimizer: A modern optimizer for real-time analytics in a distributed database

## Review

#### What's new
* A query optimizer that is distribution-aware to improve:
    * choosing join plans
    * applying query rewrites
    * appropriately costing plans
* Call the enumerator from within the query rewriter
* New distribution aware heuristics for pruning operator order search space
* Analysis of the join graph to identify, and optimize for, bushy joins (a join graph where some internal nodes do not have a leaf as a child).
