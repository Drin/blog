# CMPS 278 Paper Evaluation: The Log-Structured Merge Tree (LSM-Tree)

## Summary
The log-structured merge tree is a tree-based index that is based on a log-structured file system, originally described by Rosenblum and Ousterholt. The primary motivation is to reduce write amplification, thereby increasing write throughput and reducing write pressure on hardware (disks).

A log-structured file system approaches writing to the file system by buffering small writes to maximize write throughput to the disk.

## Review
1. The LSM-tree is based on a log-structured file system (LFS), with a major difference being that a staging area (C0) is used for buffering writes, and compactions are written to disk (C1)--assuming a 2 component LSM-tree. This is also an improvement over B-trees where updates are written into the data structure, and so page splits must be handled as part of updates to the B-tree. For multi component LSM-trees, searching has more I/O overhead compared to B-trees and has a slower search speed, but greatly reduces write amplification in the average case (pending configuration and workload).

2. The LSM-tree is motivated by reducing write amplification, so I wonder how it compares to B-trees for non-volatile RAM. I wonder how write amplification for LSM-trees compare to BW-tree and BZ-trees.
