# Introduction
This extended blog post explores the use of types to enforce consistency, and
what an equivalent implementation may look like for a declarative programmable
storage system. The importance of this is both for consistency in a large
scale, distributed programmable storage system, and for other properties that
can be similarly specified for data and operations (e.g. locality).
