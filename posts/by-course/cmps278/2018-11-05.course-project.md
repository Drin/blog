# Course Project Proposal: Cooperative storage management between a DBMS and a storage system

## Overview
[Declarative Programmable Storage][declstore] is on the horizon for my own research. As an initial step that incorporates DBMS implementation, I would like to explore the integration of an existing DBMS with an existing storage system. This work would be to take the transactional storage manager in a DBMS and replace it with calls to a minimally modified storage API. The storage system, then, would manage storage of data directly on a block device while the DBMS would logically maintain indexes and metadata, but storage and relevant caching would be handled at a lower level.

## Work Estimations and Milestones
Since there are roughly 5 weeks remaining in the course, and some portion (preferably all) of the project should be done before the end of the quarter, I break down the milestones and estimation of effort in this section.

| Letter-based Estimate | Ideal deadline | Milestone description |
| --------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| A                     | 11/09          | VM on QEMU running the linux kernel with a minimally modified BtrFS |
| A                     | 11/23          | DBMS running in VM with calls directly to btrfs for storage         |
| A                     | 11/30          | DBMS B-tree indexes also stored in btrfs storage with co-operative changes to btrfs for data storage |
| B                     | 12/05          | Benchmarks comparing DBMS on top of btrfs with DBMS communicating with btrfs directly |
