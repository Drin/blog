# Background
This blog post groups background information into three subsections:
1. [Consistency Models](consistency-models.md)
2. [Consistency Types](consistency-types.md)
3. [Declarative Programmable Storage](declarative-programmable-storage.md)

Subsections 1 and 2 provide background information necessary to talk about what
a consistency model is and the various models of consistency that have been
defined and studied. Subsection 3 then describes and defines declarative
programmable storage and then details how consistency models and consistency
types are relevant to declarative programmable storage.
