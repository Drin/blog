# Reading Queue

## Overview

This is a list of readings that I have enqueued (i.e. on-deck), but I am tired of keeping tabs open
to track them. I would also like to have a public place where I can update the list for others to see
or to make suggestions.

    Note: there are no guarantees of these readings being scheduled.
