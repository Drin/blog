## DeclStore: Layering is for the Faint of Heart

#### Relevant Readings

* [Malacology][malacology] - Describes programmable storage and how to implement CORFU on Ceph
using a programmable storage approach.

#### Problem Statement

The authors are trying to propose an approach or technique that will allow for programmable storage
systems like malacology to be easier to implement for developers, but without sacrificing the space
of possible tuning knobs and settings.

#### Related Work

The ideas for the declarative language come from work on bloom and dedalus, meanwhile the ideas for
programmable storage come from malacology and ways for re-using ceph.

#### Proposed Solution

The authors propose the use of a declarative language and the array of techniques that come with
declarative languages that allow programs to be concise and systems to optimize the programs fairly
well. The approach seems promising and better than other approaches for development, but there is
no system to be evaluated.


#### Contribution

This work is important because it bridges two areas of research that are rarely connected with each
other: declarative programming languages and storage systems. Specifically, the use of declarative
languages is part of what makes SQL so successful as a programming language and this success has
translated to the database community/industry.
