## Ivy: A Read/Write Peer-to-peer File System

#### Relevant Readings

[Wide-area Cooperative Storage with CFS][cfs]

    Describes a file system, cooperative file system (CFS), that builds on top of chord
    to provide a peer-to-peer approach to file storage by storing file blocks in a distributed
    hash table (DHash). DHash is used in the Ivy paper, and so this paper is useful for
    more details on DHash.

#### Problem Statement

The authors of Ivy are trying to design a peer-to-peer file system that removes a centralized
server for file writes and provides integrity properties for a distributed system with untrusted
peers.

The Ivy paper has an amazing related work section that very clearly distinguishes related research
into various categories: (1) Peer-to-peer storage systems, (2) LFS, (3) Distributed storage systems,
(4) Reclaiming storage--something akin to garbage collection for old data, (5) Consistency and
conflic resolution, (6) Storage on untrusted servers.

The Ivy paper attempts to solve all of the following problems in the above categories of related work
in order to provide a novel peer-to-peer file system:

1. Previous peer-to-peer storage systems were unable to distribute writes to the file system. In
most or all previous work, clients were only able to submit writes through a centralized server.

2. Log-structures file systems were the motivation for each client of Ivy having their own log. The
authors admit that the logs don't gain them performance, but they do provide the ability to submit
writes to an Ivy system in a distributed manner (each client can write in parallel).

3. Various distributed storage systems have existed up to the time this paper was written. These
include zebra, xfs, Frangipani, and Harp. The problems with these storage systems, respectively,
are that they require a single meta-data server, trustworthy servers, or use a centralized cluster
of dedicated servers.
