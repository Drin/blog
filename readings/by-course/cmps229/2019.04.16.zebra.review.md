RAID-II, DataMesh, and TickerTAIP were other solutions for high-performance
file servers. RADD is a solution proposed by Stonebraker and Schloss that
uses multiple disks, but distributed across many geolocations. While RADD
does not improve throughput, it improves reliability and redundancy.

sfs, Bridge, and CFS stripe data across I/O devices (nodes in a parallel
computer sounds like devices in a standard computer), and swift is the only
other solution the authors mention that stripes data across nodes in a
network.

File systems that try to maximize availability are Locus, Coda, Deceit, Ficus,
and Harp.

Overall, Zebra appears to have been one of the few solutions in its space,
providing improved throughput over LFS by striping data across servers within
a network.
