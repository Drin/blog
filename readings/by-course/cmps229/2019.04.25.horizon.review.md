## Horizon: Efficient Deadline-driven Disk I/O Management for Distributed Storage Systems

#### Relevant Readings


#### Problem Statement

The authors are trying to address throughput and latency performance targets for an entire data center,
or at least for entire distributed storage systems within data centers. Part of the problem that the
authors see is that data centers, or services such as load balancers, treat storage systems as black boxes
and so underutilize the performance capacity of these storage systems.

The authors propose a multi-layered approach which tags I/O requests with information (a deadline),
which disk schedulers use to prioritize I/O requests (deadline queue). Separately, a re-ordering set
is proposed to make I/O requests that have been dispatched from the deadline queue efficiently serviced.
