# File System Design for an NFS File Server Appliance

> What is the problem the authors are trying to solve?

To improve networked file system performance, Network Appliance (NetApp) decided to produce
specialized hardware for serving an NFS-based file system. This paper addresses design
concerns of a file system optimized for an NFS appliance.

> What other approaches or solutions existed at the time that this
> work was done?

At the time of this paper ('94), there were many general purpose file systems that existed.
However, there were none that were designed for specialized systems such as an NFS appliance.
The systems that the proposed approach were compared to for performance were an Auspex server
and a few Sun SPARC servers.
