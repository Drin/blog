## Avoiding the Disk Bottleneck in the Data Domain Deduplication File System

#### Problem Statement
> What is the problem the authors are trying to solve?

In order to meet industry needs, data de-duplication has become popular in disk-based systems
to defer the need to archive to tape. In this paper, the authors describe 3 techniques used in
the Data Domain File System to address disks as a bottleneck in systems that do data de-duplication.
The techniques detailed are: (1) Summary Vector, (2) Stream-informed Segment Layout, and
(3) Locality Preserved Caching.
