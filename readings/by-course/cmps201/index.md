# Readings

CMPS 201 does not have any assigned research readings. It is a lecture-based course, but I want to
include here relevant excerpts or related readings to try and get a bit more out of the course.

A schedule of the readings for CMPS 290S for my convenience. I'll also link my reading reviews as I write them, just so that this feels a bit more complete.

### Growth of Functions

#### Reading Sources
From the textbook, _Introduction to Algorithms_ (CLRS), the following references discuss asymptotic
growth of functions:
* Volume 1, [The Art of Programming]()
* [Algorithmics: Theory and Practice]()
* [Concrete Mathematics]()
* [Big Omicron and Big Omega and Big Theta](http://www.phil.uu.nl/datastructuren/09-10/knuth_big_omicron.pdf)
* A remark on Stirling's formula

From the textbook, _Computer Algorithms_, by Sara Baase and Allen Van Gelder, the following
additional references describe asymptotic growth of functions:
* [The Complexity of Songs](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358042)
