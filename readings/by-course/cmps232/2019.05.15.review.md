## Sinfonia: a new paradigm for building scalable distributed systems

#### Overall Evaluation

I really like this paper for the idea of minitransactions and the approach to distinguishing between
application nodes and memory nodes. By using semantics of a transaction to be able to execute final
operations concurrently the authors show that it is possible to reduce the number of network
round-trips. And the shift _from_ bringing data to application nodes _to_ bringing logic to memory
(or storage) nodes. This is similar in spirit to mapreduce, though I think that Sinfonia offers more
flexibility.

I also thought it was funny that "possible applications for MapReduce include distributed grep,
sort and computing inverted indexes.
