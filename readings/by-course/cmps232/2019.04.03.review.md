## Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

> What problem does the paper solve? Is is important?
  
The paper tries to address the question of whether an event A _happened before_
an event B. Specifically, this is a question of how can we determine the ordering
for a particular pair of events. This is a very important question for the use
of distributed systems for applications that provide concurrent access to shared,
mutable state by distributed processes.

> How does it solve the problem?

By defining a particular relation of interest, _happens before_. The resolution
of this relation for a pair of events allows developers to correctly implement
particular scenarios of interprocess dependencies.
  
> What alternative approaches are there? Are they adequately discussed in the reading?
