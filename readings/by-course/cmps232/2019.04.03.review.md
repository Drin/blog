## Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

> What problem does the paper solve? Is is important?
  
The paper tries to address the question of whether an event A _happened before_
an event B. Specifically, this is a question of how can we determine the ordering
for a particular pair of events. This is a very important question for the use
of distributed systems for applications that provide concurrent access to shared,
mutable state by distributed processes.

> How does it solve the problem?

The question of which events happen before other events is solved by the definition
of a particular relation of interest, _happens before_. This relation captures 3
properties: (1) all events in a process are in order of _happens before_ from
earliest event to latest event, (2) for a given communication message, the sending
process _happens before_ the receiving process, (3) _happens before_ is transitive.
  
> What alternative approaches are there? Are they adequately discussed in the reading?
  

  
> How does this work relate to other research, whether covered in this course or not?

A significant portion of distributed systems is related to addressing the problem
of communicating over an asynchronous, faulty network. The approach that this paper
takes to order events by a _happens before_ relation provides some guarantees of
how to... <!-- TBD -->
