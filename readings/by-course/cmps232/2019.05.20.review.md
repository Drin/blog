## A comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types

#### Overall Evaluation

This paper details shared data types, which receive and process updates at
one replica and then update state at other replicas, using "simple" formal
conditions that guarantee eventual consistency. The authors call these data
types convergent replicated data types, or commutative replicated data types.
The convergent and commutative terms refer to how updates of state converge
or how update operations commute.
