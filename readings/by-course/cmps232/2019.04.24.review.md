## Towards a Cloud Computing Research Agenda

#### Relevant Readings


#### Overall Evaluation

The paper mostly begins with a definition of cloud computing that seems adequate, but I believe is operational
in definition, and not particularly principled. Below is a diagram of my own making that will be used as a
reference for describing the given definition of cloud computing.

First, I will use the terms "Core" and "Surface" to distinguish the definitions of cloud computing from an
_outside perspective_ and from an _inside perspective_. The following ascii art comes from [some ascii art
website][ascii-cloud], which I then annotate.


                      Surface
                      .-~~~-.
              .- ~ ~-(       )_ _
            /                     ~ -.
    Surface| <------>  Core  <------>  \ Surface
            \       (tHe cLOuD)       .'
              ~- . _____________ . -~
                      Surface


Second, I provide a diagram that collapses the above idea into a 2-dimensional, layered layout:

           
                                      +---------+                +-------------+
    ##############   External         |         | Internal       |             |
    # Client     #   Communication    | Surface | Communication  |  Core       |
    # (outskirt) #   <------------>   | (edge)  | <------------> |  (central)  |
    ##############                    |         |                |             |
                                      +---------+                +-------------+

The cloud computing definition is given in 4 parts:

1. The *first part* describes what a cloud looks like from a client machine, cited from wikipedia.
2. The *second part* describes standards, or typical approaches, that developers expect of the
   external communication (how the client talks to some cloud servers at the edge).
3. The *third part* describes how the surface and core servers of the cloud are typically
   architected--how is system state managed (configuration), how are client data managed (storage
   systems and databases), how are the servers managed (hardware/virtual platform provisioning),
   and what is the communication substrate (the networking infrastructure).
4. The *fourth part* describes architecture and logic, provided by the core servers and infrastructure,
   for _long term maintainability_--how are tasks scheduled, how is storage managed (archival, etc.).
   
    
Associated Standards:

* Accessed by: browsers, "mini-browsers", web services
* Supported by: Huge amounts of hardware (many data centers, load balancers, networking infrastructure, etc.)
* External servers (potentially in DMZs) perform "business logic" between cloud services and clients
