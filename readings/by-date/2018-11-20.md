# Paper Review: GraphX: Graph Processing in a Distributed Dataflow Framework

## Review

#### What's new
* Treating vertices and edges as separate collections to process using joins. This logical construction is very very old, but this paper shows the first time that this approach is taken in an application in a performant way.
* The use of 3 general dataflow operators to express graph algorithms in a generic dataflow framework (spark):
    * join
    * group-by
    * map

#### Thoughts/Comments
1. I assume that representations of graphs as matrices or lists evolved from legacy performance constraints. Although data access patterns may have been able to satisfy the GraphX approach, I think it's interesting that somehow the combination of spark's programming model and improvements in data storage seems to be what made GraphX's approach possible.

2. The distributed graph representation is incredibly important, and I think it's really smart to send vertex information to nodes containing edge information. In addition to there being a lot more edges (more entities to send), I think that if adjacent edges for high-degree nodes are in the same partition, it is clear that the amount of data shuffles should be greatly reduced. I wish this point had more attention than the brief sentence it had.
