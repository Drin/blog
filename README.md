# Research Blog
I am just starting a PhD in computer science, and am interested in keeping my
writings in an accessible, "blog-able" format, and this is my first attempt
at that!

**Note**: This is a repository for blog-like posts in markdown, in the style of
[Frank McSherry's Blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog)

For now, I will maintain descriptions of posts in this README as a Table of
Contents (TOC) in reverse chronological order (seems like a sensible default).
This is also currently done manually, but I will likely try to automate this in
the near-ish future; so bear with me! This README may not always be kept up to
date, but I'll do my best :)

#### [CMPS 290S Reading and Presentation Schedule](https://github.com/Drin/blog/blob/master/research-blog/research-blog-content/readings/by-course/cmps290s/index.md)

Here I have laid out the reading schedule for my CMPS 290S class and I will add
my reading responses as I do them.

I have also added a schedule at the top for my presentations, which will
include links to my presentation slides.

#### [CMPS 278 Reading Schedule](https://github.com/Drin/blog/blob/master/research-blog/research-blog-content/readings/by-course/cmps278/index.md)
I have already fallen way behind in keeping this up to date. But, for my own
convenience, I have put a schedule of the readings for CMPS 278, and I will
eventually update them with links to the papers (though likely privately
available only since I don't want to be held accountable for publishing them).

Anyways, hopefully I can find the time (and sanity) to keep up with this more.
I will definitely want to keep up with everything as I do blog posts for CMPS
290S, and get started on my various course projects.
