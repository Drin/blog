# Research Blog
I am a 1st year PhD student in computer science, and I am interested in keeping my writings in an
accessible, online format! 

More about me [here](profile/index.md)!

I will attempt to add new content as bite-sized blog posts, and every so often I will coalesce
related posts into a separate "book" format (see [mdbook format][mdbook]). This README may not
always be kept up to date, but I'll do my best :)

## Content Overview
This repository will hopefully contain a majority of blog/written descriptions of my research as I
continue through my PhD. I am going to try separating content into: explorations, readings, and a
"book".

### Explorations
I thought "explorations" would be a nice name for a section containing extended blog posts, or
series of blog posts for something research-y or project-based. Some projects described in
explorations may also include short and sweet (or not sweet) side projects.

[Mixing Consistency in a Programmable Storage System][mixing-consistency]

[Diversifying Consistency in Ceph][diversify-consistency]

[Series - Programmable Access Libraries][programmable-access-libs]

[Series - LDFI for Life][ldfi-for-life]

### Working Groups and/or projects
For things that aren't worked on solely by myself and that have a physical piece already, I'll
list here.

[Sidecar working group - Envoyage][envoyage]

### Readings
This section will include paper reviews, paper presentation materials, and anything else that seems
relatively similar in spirit.

To make this area a bit easier to traverse (especially for myself), I am organizing readings into
"by-course" directories and "by-date" directories. This will allow me to maintain a Table of
Contents, or schedule, for each course and also to keep some semblance of the ordering in which the
readings were done, just for convenience. At the top of each schedule, I will have links and
information on my paper presentations, which will include links to my presentation slides. Then the
rest of the schedule will just be for the course readings.

#### Readings by Date
Eventually I'll keep some number of most recent readings/reviews, but for now, to see reviews by
date, simply go to this index: [reviews by date][reading-by-date].
