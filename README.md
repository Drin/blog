### About Me

I am currently a 2nd year PhD student in computer science ([CMPS][ucsc-phd-reqs]) at UC Santa Cruz.
My advisor is Peter Alvaro and I am primarily working with Peter Alvaro, Carlos Maltzahn, and
Jeff LeFevre on [declarative programmable storage][project-programmability], but I am also interested
in bioinformatics, distributed systems, and data management systems.

Here, I am hoping to publish my thoughts and research, as well as keep track of readings. I mostly
failed to write the content I wanted to last year, but will hopefully be able to commit more
time this year.


### TA Information

This quarter, Fall 2019, I am TAing for [CSE 138 - Distributed Systems][ucsc-cse138]. Below is
information for contacting me and where my physical office is located. I have had professors that
offered online office hours and were available via instant message as well, so I'd like to provide
the same. I can be contacted anytime online and I should be able to respond within 24 hours in
most cases. Please use my ucsc google account for all forms of messaging (IM or email). For now,
I am only doing ad-hoc office hours (when requested), but if regular office hours would be preferred,
please let me know.

    Office Location    : LSD Lab (E2 - 398; near the staircase of Engineering 2)
    Office Hours       : By Appointment
    Online Office Hours: By Appointment
    
    Contact Info       :
        E-mail         : akmontan@ucsc.edu
        Hangouts (IM)  : akmontan@ucsc.edu
        Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YWttb250YW5AdWNzYy5lZHU
        Zoom           : See office hour events on calendar

# Research

### Theorycrafting

I always thought [theorycrafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorycraft) was a fun word for a fun idea.
This section indexes blog posts, or series of blog posts, for something research-y or project-based where I
am ultimately "theorycrafting" (assuming life is a game and/or simulation). Some of the series below may also
include short and sweet (or not sweet) side projects.

This will be the least complete of all the sections on this website as I have found it is hard for me to take
various thoughts to completion in a blog format. I tend to keep these thoughts in notes or just in my head,
though I am trying to improve on this.

### Readings

This section will include paper reviews, paper presentation materials, and anything else that seems
relatively similar in spirit. I will try to eventually organize the reading sections below in a way
that it can be easy to tell what I have read, what I thought about it, and maybe gather some fun
statistics on my reading progress.


#### &middot; [Reading Queue](readings/reading-queue.md)
I think it would be nice to keep a public reading queue. Maybe others can make recommendations, or at least
get a sense of what papers I think should be read for anyone in my field.


#### Readings by Research Group

| Principal Investigators (PIs)    | Group                                               |

#### Readings by Date

To see reviews by date, simply go to this index: [reviews by date][reading-by-date]. This
will be updated periodically, when I need to procrastinate important work or when I feel
like it should be updated.
