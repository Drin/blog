I am currently a 2nd year PhD student in computer science at UC Santa Cruz, and I am interested
in writing frequently to make my thoughts and work available and transparent online! I mostly
failed to write the content I wanted to last year, but will hopefully be able to commit more
time this year.

### TA Information

This quarter, Fall 2019, I am TAing for CSE 138 - Distributed Systems. Below is information for
contacting me, when I plan to hold office hours, and where my physical office is located. I have had
professors that offered online office hours and were available via instant message as well, so I'd
like to provide the same. I will make myself available for online office hours and my ucsc google
account can be used to instant message me. For now I have chosen 2 hours on Saturdays for online
office hours, but please let me know if a different time would be more convenient (or perhaps weekday
evenings?).

    Office Location    : LSD Lab (E2 - 398; near the staircase of Engineering 2)
    Office Hours       : Tuesday/Thursday [10 AM or 2:00 PM?]
    Online Office Hours: Saturdays 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM
    
    Contact Info       :
        E-mail         : akmontan@ucsc.edu
        Hangouts (IM)  : akmontan@ucsc.edu
        Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YWttb250YW5AdWNzYy5lZHU
        Zoom           : See office hour events on calendar

### Explorations
Here is a table providing an overview of the various sections, or "explorations", containing blog posts,
or series of blog posts for something research-y or project-based. Some of the series below may also include
short and sweet (or not sweet) side projects.

| Type   | Name                                                                                              |

### Readings
This section will include paper reviews, paper presentation materials, and anything else that seems
relatively similar in spirit.

To make this area a bit easier to traverse (especially for myself), I am organizing readings into
"by-course" directories and "by-date" directories. This will allow me to maintain a Table of
Contents, or schedule, for each course and also to keep some semblance of the ordering in which the
readings were done, just for convenience. At the top of each schedule, I will have links and
information on my paper presentations, which will include links to my presentation slides. Then the
rest of the schedule will just be for the course readings.

#### [Reading Queue](readings/reading-queue.md)
My queue of readings to do

#### Readings by Date
Eventually I'll keep some number of most recent readings/reviews, but for now, to see reviews by
date, simply go to this index: [reviews by date][reading-by-date]. This will be updated periodically,
when I need to procrastinate important work or when I feel like it should be updated.

#### Readings by Group

| Principal Investigators (PIs)    | Group                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Peter Alvaro                     | [Disorderly Labs][group-disorderly]                 |
| Peter Alvaro and Carlos Maltzahn | [Declarative Programmable Storage][group-declstore] |

#### Readings by Course
