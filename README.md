# Research Blog
I am a 1st year PhD student in computer science, and I am interested in keeping my writings in an
accessible, "blog-able" format, and this is my first attempt at that!

**Note**: This is a repository for blog-like posts in markdown, in the style of [Frank McSherry's
Blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog).

I attempted to keep this README updated, but that lasted a very very short while. What I have
decided could be nice, is to link to various indexes for subdirectories, which will serve as a
hierarchical blog index. By doing it this way, I can also try out maintaining this blog in [mdbook
format](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/) as well.

This README may not always be kept up to date, but I'll do my best :)

## Course-related content
Here I organize all of the sections of this blog that are course related (clearly). This means
paper reviews, paper presentation materials, and anything else that seems fair to openly publish.

Each course will have it's own index which will be like a Table of Contents or schedule for the
course. At the top of each schedule, I will have links and information on my paper presentations,
which will include links to my presentation slides. Then the rest of the schedule will just be for
the course readings.

### Explorations
A more exciting title than course projects, I thought explorations would be a nice section that can
include course projects and any research projects that I blog about. I also figured that some
course projects may themselves become research projects, so explorations is meant to be a section
that captures these projects, even if very short and sweet (or not sweet).

### Reading reviews by date
To make it easy to manage all content in a single location, I would like to _also_ keep reading
reviews organized in a single location named and organized by date. Since they will be located in a
single directory, I link it here, where the below section will continue to grow while I'm in grad
school (and potentially "forever"!).

### Reading reviews by course
For my own convenience, I am maintaining sections for each course where I can keep track of a
schedule of the readings for the quarter. I will try to maintain links to papers, and even links to
materials I prepare for any presentations I give.
