# [Research Blog](http://research.aldrinmontana.com) &middot; [Aldrin Montana](profile)
I am currently a 1st year PhD student in computer science at UC Santa Cruz, and I am interested
in writing frequently to make my thoughts and work available and transparent online!

I will attempt to add new content as bite-sized blog posts, and every so often I will coalesce
related posts into a separate "book" format (see [mdbook format][mdbook]). This README may not
always be kept up to date, but I'll do my best :) I am going to try separating content into:
explorations, readings, and "books".

---
### Explorations
I thought "explorations" would be a nice name for a section containing extended blog posts, or
series of blog posts for something research-y or project-based. Some projects described in
explorations may also include short and sweet (or not sweet) side projects.

| Type   | Post                                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blog   | [Mixing Consistency in a Programmable Storage System][mixing-consistency] |
| Blog   | [Diversifying Consistency in Ceph][diversify-consistency]                 |
| Series | [Series - LDFI for Life][ldfi-for-life]                                    |
| Series | [Series - Programmable Access Libraries][programmable-access-libs]        |


### Working Groups and/or projects
For things that aren't worked on solely by myself and that have a physical piece already, I'll
list here.

### Readings
This section will include paper reviews, paper presentation materials, and anything else that seems
relatively similar in spirit.

To make this area a bit easier to traverse (especially for myself), I am organizing readings into
"by-course" directories and "by-date" directories. This will allow me to maintain a Table of
Contents, or schedule, for each course and also to keep some semblance of the ordering in which the
readings were done, just for convenience. At the top of each schedule, I will have links and
information on my paper presentations, which will include links to my presentation slides. Then the
rest of the schedule will just be for the course readings.

#### Readings by Date
Eventually I'll keep some number of most recent readings/reviews, but for now, to see reviews by
date, simply go to this index: [reviews by date][reading-by-date].

#### Readings by Course

##### First Year &middot; Fall 2018 - Spring 2019
