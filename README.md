# blog
I am just starting a PhD in computer science, and am interested in keeping my
writings in an accessible, "blog-able" format, and this is my first attempt
at that!

**Note**: This is a repository for blog-like posts in markdown, in the style of
[Frank McSherry's Blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog)

For now, I will maintain descriptions of posts in this README as a Table of
Contents (TOC) in reverse chronological order (seems like a sensible default).
This is also currently done manually, but I will likely try to automate this in
the near-ish future; so bear with me! This README may not always be kept up to
date, but I'll do my best :)
