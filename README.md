About Me
--------

I am currently a 2nd year PhD student in computer science ([CMPS][ucsc-phd-reqs]) at UC Santa Cruz.
My advisor is Peter Alvaro and I am primarily working with Peter Alvaro, Carlos Maltzahn, and
Jeff LeFevre on [declarative programmable storage][project-programmability], but I am also interested
in bioinformatics, distributed systems, and data management systems.

Here, I am hoping to publish my thoughts and research, as well as keep track of readings. I mostly
failed to write the content I wanted to last year, but will hopefully be able to commit more
time this year.

### TA Information

This quarter, Fall 2019, I am TAing for CSE 138 - Distributed Systems. Below is information for
contacting me and where my physical office is located. I have had professors that offered online
office hours and were available via instant message as well, so I'd like to provide the same. I can
be contacted anytime online and I should be able to respond within 24 hours in most cases. Please
use my ucsc google account for all forms of messaging (IM or email). For now, I am only doing ad-hoc
office hours (when requested), but if regular office hours would be preferred, please let me know.

    Office Location    : LSD Lab (E2 - 398; near the staircase of Engineering 2)
    Office Hours       : By Appointment
    Online Office Hours: Feel free to contact anytime
    
    Contact Info       :

### Explorations
Here is a table providing an overview of the various sections, or "explorations", containing blog posts,
or series of blog posts for something research-y or project-based. Some of the series below may also include
short and sweet (or not sweet) side projects.

### Readings
This section will include paper reviews, paper presentation materials, and anything else that seems
relatively similar in spirit.

To make this area a bit easier to traverse (especially for myself), I am organizing readings into
"by-course" directories and "by-date" directories. This will allow me to maintain a Table of
Contents, or schedule, for each course and also to keep some semblance of the ordering in which the
readings were done, just for convenience. At the top of each schedule, I will have links and
information on my paper presentations, which will include links to my presentation slides. Then the
rest of the schedule will just be for the course readings.

#### [Reading Queue](readings/reading-queue.md)
My queue of readings to do

#### Readings by Date
Eventually I'll keep some number of most recent readings/reviews, but for now, to see reviews by
date, simply go to this index: [reviews by date][reading-by-date]. This will be updated periodically,
when I need to procrastinate important work or when I feel like it should be updated.

#### Readings by Group

| Principal Investigators (PIs)    | Group                                               |

| Peter Alvaro and Carlos Maltzahn | [Declarative Programmable Storage][group-declstore] |
