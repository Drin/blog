# Paper Review: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions

## Review

#### What's new
* A new isolation model defined based on the idea of _atomic visibility_, called read atomic isolation.
* Use of partition and synchronization independent critieria for developing RAMP algorithms

#### Thoughts/Comments
1. Partition independence (replica availability) and synchronization independence (transactional availability) were presented in a very clear and concise way. For transactional availability, a transaction should not depend on another to complete (should not need to synchronize with every replication server), and for partition independence, only the partitions needed for the data should be necessary to commit a transaction. I really liked these formulations and think it even makes it easier to think about how atomic visibility differs from read-committed and repeatable reads. I think that read atomic isolation is in between read-committed and repeatable read isolation levels in strictness.

2. After reading the paper about reducing un-scalable communications, I feel like the RAMP algorithms mentioned could do something like find intersections between read and write-sets and only request newer versions for data not in the intersection (versions that different between read/write sets returned very close in time). I think this would be a very cool extension to these RAMP algorithms.
